## Demo

https://ts-todolist-r4rmdj09b-jun-tsuno.vercel.app

## Build With

- React
- TypeScript
- Firebase(Authentication, FireStore)
- tailwindcss
- MUI
- Vite

## Challenges

- This is my first project with Firebase, and it was tough to understand how the Firebase storage stores data and how to retrieve the data form components at first. I gained a basic understanding of how to connect a database with CRUD functionality, as well as how to handle asynchronous data fetching.

- By adding 'Dark Mode' in this app, I also learned how to override the MaterialUI default styling. It strengthens my understanding of the usage and customization of the UI components.
